# ChromeStrapp

[This blog post](http://chrome.blogspot.co.uk/2013/09/a-new-breed-of-chrome-apps.html) marked Chrome's 5th birthday, and a big step forward in the way Chrome apps can be delivered, straight to the desktop.

Developing for the web is great, but nobody likes the endless fiddling of cross-browser compatability. When making an app for a single browser, you only have one rendering engine, one API, and one set of supported features to worry about.

To provide a quick start for Chrome specific apps, I decided to piece together this simple boilerplate. I've borrowed (stolen) most of the stylesheet from the excellent [html5boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/), but I have removed the cross-browser compatability stuff, allowing me to focus on one thing: making awesome packaged apps for Google Chrome.

In the long run, I wouldn't say this is a good idea. I think it's great that we have a lot of browsers, and while it's a pain in the neck making things work on all/as many as possible of them, competition breeds innovation. In "real life" you are unlikely to want to tie yourself down to any one browser, especially if you want people to actually *use* you app, but maybe this will provide a good launch pad.

## What next?

As I dive into creating apps with this as a base, I want to add the menus and widgets that we've come to expect from our desktop apps.
